Hello!

This is my first idea of a project to take my skill up in development!

I am taking the marksheet supplied to teachers and eliminating some grunt work they do when finding out marks of students.

This is not intended to REPLACE anything except for manual data analysis.  Regular data processing in excel or other common practice among storing data should be done afterwards.  

This is just a little tool, made with love :)
