Hello!

This is my first idea of a project that maybe of some use to teachers in Fiji!

I am taking the marksheet supplied to teachers and eliminating some grunt work they do when finding out marks of students.

This is not intended to REPLACE anything except for manual data analysis.  Regular data processing in excel or other common practice among storing data should be done afterwards.  

This is just a little tool, made with love :)
